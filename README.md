# avalancheTests
Author: Daniel Popov https://github.com/damy90/avalanche-tests-react

Hopefully, this web page will one day be a crowd sorced avalanche buletin, where freeride skiers can share info instanteniously. I was "inspired" by the joke that is the official buletin where I live. 

The projest uses react.js, Leafet.js, Bootstrap and jQuery


This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
